									<p>Upon doing research on Neuralink, I have gathered information and a clear understanding that the technology for Neuralink needs a lot more time for its own research to be done before it is considered 100 percent safe to even be tested on humans. It will take years for the technology to reach it's sought potential. Researchers and neuroscientists themselves are anxious about the potential  harm  the Neuralink device will inflict on real humans. The technology is not yet proven and there are questions for the founder, Elon Musk, about his ethics towards his start-up. The judgement imposed on him about whether this start-upidea is innovative or not, or if it will indeed meet requirements that are needed for the technology to be successful. Therefore, I do not feel confident about the proposed impacts it has deemed to make to change the future of people who are impaired mentally and/or physically.</p>
									<p>Good professional ethics are supposed to show that the correspondence that employees send out meet their mission and values. Ethics are supposed to ensure that there is full compliance and regulations regarding avoiding harm to others and to be honest and trustworthy about any occurrence that causes a hinderance for a company’s competence to complete an objective. (Associating for Computing Machinery, 2018). Computing professionals must also <i>“credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, and artifacts, and respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works.” (Associating for Computing Machinery, 2018)</i>. Elon Musk has failed to provide compliance, resulting in the public and scientists not being confident in his aspirations for Neuralink. For this start-up to meet the ethics that revolve around a foundation of a company, there needs to be more thought into how the idea will truly be successful, instead of building false hope for a profit.</p>
