									<h3 class="mb-4">What is Neuralink?</h3>
									<p>Neuralink is a technology founded and developed by Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk in the field of brain-machine interface devices and technology. The company says it is "Developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers". Musk has said his main goal through all of his companies is to push humanity forward. While Musk has a lot of supporters, some are more skeptical about him and his plans for the future. Vocal critics say Musk simply reinvents technology that already exists and is <i>"living in a fantasy"</i>.</p>
									<p>Musk says Neuralink will directly connect individuals with their phones, or computers. Musk, at a recent product update on Neuralink said, <i>"In a lot of ways, itâ€™s kind of like a Fitbit in your skull, with tiny wires", Musk, E. (2021)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref3">[3]</a></b></sub>. While neuroscience pioneer and BMI <i>(brain-machine interface)</i> expert Miguel Nicolelis, says the technology is <i>"Totally bogus"</i>, and <i>"for a science fiction movie, that's fine, but for Elon Musk to come out and say exactly the same thing is bogus", Nicolelis, M. (2021)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref3">[3]</a></b></sub>.</p>
									<p>The device connects via the brain's neurons with tiny electrodes that are inserted into the brain via a neurosurgery robot that Neuralink is also developing to undertake the surgery required to implant the device. Some say that this robot is the most promising development coming out of Neuralink so far.</p>	</div>

									<h3 class="mb-4">Neuralink's Capabilities</h3>
									<p>Neuralink is still working on their first consumer design, however, during this time they have released a number of presentations of the device so far &#8212; mostly animal trials. These presentations have shown the current capability of the technology, while also giving the Neuralink team a place to discuss and speak about the companies future ambitions and future capabilities.</p>
									<p>The presentations mainly focus on the the Neuralink team's main device, the Link, which records brain activity through small electrodes implanted inside the brain. All the activities are then sent from the Link to the mobile device or computer connected to the link.</p>
									<p>After connecting the Link to the mobile device or computer, the user will then be able to communicate with the device using the data being sent from the Link.</p>
									<p>In the future, the functionality of the Link may be improved before release, or with over-the-air updates. Many of the current features being shown now are still being developed and tested, and still require time to fully develop.</p>
									<p>Another field the company is working on is the automation of the surgery that will be required to implant the Link inside someone. This robot is fully automated and it's job is strictly to make the incisions required and connect all 1024 of the electrodes into the correct places in the brain. The team says this is the only possible way to implant a device like this in a person's head, as the electrodes are so small, that a human hand couldn't possibly be sharp enough to correctly connect all of the electrodes. The team says the robot will have to be perfectly precise and the procedure should take less than an hour without general anesthesia.</p>

									<h3 class="mb-4">The Monkey Test</h3>
									<p class="justify-left">
									This is a famous video, demonstrating the power of Neuralink. The test involves a monkey, which has been implanted with the Neuralink chip, moving a cursor around in a game with a controller. This, on the surface, seems fairly unextraordinary, as many monkeys before have been trained to play mind games. However, this specific monkey only <i>believes</i> he is controlling the game with the controller. In reality, the controller is unplugged, the only thing controlling the cursor is the input the Neuralink chip in it's brain is recieving. The impulses the monkeys brain is outputting is being sent to the Neuralink, which subsequently, is then outputting the signals to a computer. The computer then translates these digitised impuleses into the cursor movement on the screen. In this case, there is an external computer deciphering the Neuralink output, but the final goal is to be able to perform all of this on a mobile device, or even on the chip itself.</p>
