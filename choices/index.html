									<h3 class="mb-4">Regulation</h3>
									<p>Neuralink, like many other conceived technologies, created or  not as of yet, have the power for a huge amount of good. But this must be weighed up against the potential bad and government regulation must be brought into the question.</p>
									<p>As of yet, governments around the world have been slow regulating the likes of social media giants and cryptocurrency, with consistent policies still yet to arrive on these matters.</p>
									<p>Governments must prepare themselves for whatever may come next and be in front of the ball for when these technologies arrive. None of these technologies will be as important to regulate however as artificial intelligence, human/machine symbiosis and modifications. Technology like this has the ability to create massive amounts of discrimination, and the question of how far an employer can go to request candidates who perhaps have certain modifications or technologies.</p>
									<p>These questions will be at the center of discussion in the coming decades and governments around the world must be ready to take on the challenge of facing them head on.</p>

									<h3 class="mb-4">Human/Machine Symbiosis</h3>
									<p>A positive outlook for humanity on this topic would be the possibility that if artificial intelligence is indeed benevolent, however far exceeding our abilities, a symbiosis between human and machine is possible. Musk even goes as far as to say <i>"the best way to avoid a dystopian nightmare is to form a symbiosis with machines". Bhavsar, N. (2017)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref7">[7]</a></b></sub>.</p>
									<p>While some will take a more conservative stance on this, it may end up being our last chance of surviving in a “post-singularity” world. We must keep ahead of the curve if we are to survive in an AI driven world.</p>
									<p>Musk says that integrating ourselves with AI can possibly solve the "usefulness problem". An issue where <i>"automation and technology threaten our usefulness as organic organisms". Bhavsar, N. (2017)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref7">[7]</a></b></sub>.</p>
									<p>Computers are able to communicate and transmit information much faster than humans can, hence, if a "singularity" type event does in fact take place, we may find anything we can offer in terms of meaningful output, can be done by a computer at a faster speed. By integrating ourselves with AI and artificially increasing our own speed of communication of information, me may be able to survive such an event.</p>
									<p>If we can begin to accept the idea of Human/Machine symbiosis at this basic level, we may be more prepared to take on the future, and help ensure the best possible outcomes.</p>
									<p>On the other hand another paper regarding the topic of Neuralink and Artificial Intelligence Symbiosis mentions, <i>"Over the course of time, it has become very evident that meddling in the natural process can cause a huge amount of destruction", Kulshreshth, A. Anand, A. Lakhanpal, A. (2019)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref9">[9]</a></b></sub>. There is some evidence that the technology that Neuralink is designing can be linked to permanent long-term damage to the brain. As the brain shifts it's shape, the stiff threads can cause issues. Whether issues like this will be solved to further push Musk's idea of a symbiotic relationship with AI further is yet to be seen. The question of AI superiority to humans is a contentious one, <i>"Being the creator of artificial intelligence, we shouldn't hold ourselves lowly than the creation", Kulshreshth, A. Anand, A. Lakhanpal, A. (2019)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref9">[9]</a></b></sub>. If the idea that AI will in fact, take over our world and prove itself more intelligent, does not come to fruition, the likelyhood a product like the Link will be required for us to keep up with AI would be low. This fact may turn out to be a conflict of interest in Musk's future plans.</p>
