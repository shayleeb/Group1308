									<h3 class="mb-4">How Will Neuralink Make a Difference?</h3>
									<p>Neuralink aims to create a direct connection between the human mind and computers. Initially, Neuralink aims to help disabled people interact and use computers. It also aims to improve the speed of communication between people and devices.</p>
									<p>The company has future goals to move the scope of their goals further towards <i>"the ultimate use-case of Neuralink which is to help paraplegic people with spinal injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other brain memory disorders...", KVN, R. (2020)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref6">[6]</a></b></sub>. Along with completely transforming the lives of everyday people and increasing the speed at which we communicate with computers on a daily basis.</p>

									<h3 class="mb-4">Medical Usages</h3>
									<p>The Link's initial main usage will be in that of the medical field, <i>"helping people with a wide range of injuries and neurological disorders", Neuralink. (2021)</i><sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref2">[2]</a></b></sub>.</p>
									<p>Similar to the wheelchair of the late Stephen Hawking, the Link promises communication with devices in a way that could allow people who have lost motor control speak or move prostetics. Musk has said that the Link impants could be also be used to assist tetraplegic people to gain their motor controls back<sub><b><a href="../references/index.html#ref6">[6]</a></b></sub>.</p>
									<p>Along with this, the ability to communicate via computers and devices is a possibility, and could allow a new field of computer controlled prostetics and generated speech synthesisers to develop.</p>
									<p>The Link is being developed with an app for users to be able to communicate and trasmit information to devices and computers. Initially this technology will be used to control software and collect diagnostic data, however eventually this technology could be used to control electronic prostetics.</p>

									<h3 class="mb-4">Future Impact of Neuralink</h3>
									<p>While Elon Musk has claimed that future iterations will be able to solve issues such as memory loss, brain and neurological disorders, the future impact of technologies such as Neuralink are unknown, as a technology like this has never fully been available or adopted by the wider public.</p>
									<p>A possible parallel can be made through the adoption of the smartphone, where initially, the smartphone was used as a tool for very specific purposes. Over time the smartphone was adopted and built to cater for a wider audience, and hence gained public adoption. A case could be made that most people don't "need" smartphones, or use them for any specific purpose. However, over time, not having a smartphone may put a person at a certain disadvantage after a large number of their peers have adopted the technology. This is where a similar case with implantable and wearable technologies could be made.</p>
									<p>Developments such as Neuralink also create a possibility to lead humanity down a technocratic and further discriminatory path.</p>
