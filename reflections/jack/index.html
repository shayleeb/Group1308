									<p>As with many other emerging technologies, Neuralink has the possibility to become a part of our daily lives, very similarly to the way smartphones have changed our lives. The technology has the power to create a huge amount of good for the intended market, focusing on people with brain injuries and neurological diseases. However, a conversation needs to be had around the possibility of technologies like this being adopted by the everyday person, which could lead to a population of people who choose to alter themselves for the benefits of such a technology.</p>
									<p>The positives of such a technology are great. Technologies such as Neuralink and the field it operates in, may lead to further advancement in the field of neuralogical studies and working towards possible cures for diseases such as Altzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, diseases which currently have no cures or treatments. Openings for further and more precise study in these fields would be an overall positive for humanity.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, the negatives that are possible through technologies like this are also extensive. If enough able people adopt the technology, and find massive benefit from it that they gain an advantage over people who have opted not to use the technology, there could be descrimination that occurs between the “altered” and “non-altered” people. While it sounds like science fiction, this already occurs in jobs that require employees to have a mobile phone on them at all times so they are contactable. They may also need to be able to respond to email and other work related activities away from their workplace. This depends on the employee having a smartphone, not to gain an advantage over others, but because, at this point, they would be at a disavantage in comparison to their peers. I see a similar future if Neuralink delivers on it’s promises to be able to let people interface with computers and devices at incredible speeds. It could become a situation where to not have a Neuralink, or Neuralink type device, would put someone at a disadvantage to their peers.</p>
									<p>Ethically, I believe it would be wrong to allow people to gain such an advantage over their fellow man, by having the money, or the will to have a device implanted in their brain. An argument could be made that the smartphone is already a part of us, and is a cybernetic extension of ourselves and hence there is no difference.</p>
									<p>The ACM Code of Ethics, <i>fig 1.2 states, <b>Avoid harm</b></i>. Harm meaning any negative consequences, well intended or not. <i>“Well intended actions, including those that accomplish assigned duties, may lead to harm. When that harm is unintended, those responsible are obliged to undo or mitigate the harm as much as possible.”, ACM Code of Ethics. (2021). Fig 1.2.</i> In this statement we can see that Neuralink, and other companies producing other possibly permanent society changing technologies, should have a backstop to be able to fall back upon if their products are to unintentionally cause harm upon society. This is something we do not see with many of the statements of future, society wide, adoption of their products and features.</p>
									<p>Another figure in the ACM Code of Ethics is <i>fig 1.4, <b>Be fair and take action not to discriminate</b></i>. While Neuralink itself wouldn’t technically be responsible for any discriminatory acts in the case of the products they are developing, an argument could be made that possible new technologies of this kind have the power to create or enhance existing inequities. Creating a product that has the possibility to split mankind, could be considered walking a fine line in regards to <i>“taking action to avoid creating systems or technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people”, ACM Code of Ethics. (2021). Fig 1.4.</i></p>
									<p>My personal reccomendations to Neuralink or any company working on developing similar products in this field would include working towards limiting the possible advantages the devices could bring towards able bodied and minded people. The device should purely be used to help lessen inequities between the abled and disabled people, rather than create a whole new possible discriminatory path in the process.</p>
